The preferred way to configure the theme is to use the utility the theme plugin provides which help configure the theme in a concise manner using a builder-like API:\nCompile / paradoxMaterialTheme := {\n  ParadoxMaterialTheme()\n    .withColor(\"red\", \"orange\")\n    .withLogoIcon(\"cloud\")\n    .withCopyright(\"Copyleft © Jonas Fonseca\")\n}\nFull source at GitHub\nThe examples given in the following sections use an alternative syntax.

As a result it is also possible to set properties directly using paradoxProperties or front matter. Front matter allows you to tweak the look-and-feel for specific pages. The equivalent of the above configuration can be defined in front matter as:\n---\nmaterial.color.primary: red\nmaterial.color.accent: orange\nmaterial.logo.icon: cloud\nmaterial.copyright: Copyleft © Jonas Fonseca\n---\nSee the following sections for available options.","title":"Configuring the theme"},{"location":"/getting-started.html#changing-the-color-palette","text":"A default hue is defined for every primary and accent color on Google’s Material Design color palette, which makes it very easy to change the overall look of the theme.

Valid values are: red, pink, purple, deep-purple, indigo, blue, light-blue, cyan, teal, green, light-green, lime, yellow, amber, orange, deep-orange, brown, grey, blue-grey and white. The last four colors can only be used as a primary color.\nIf the color is set via this configuration, an additional CSS file that defines the color palette is automatically included.
